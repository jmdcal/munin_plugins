Install runner_aggr runner_http runner_bots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These plugins are made for Nginx, so do not use that if you haven't.
Nginx needs to be installed and configured before you setup. In this situation,
you can run generate.py script. Before do that, be sure to change etc/env/py in 
according with your configuration, especially NGINX_SITES and MUNIN_PLUGINS.
After that, you can check the usage as usual (-h):

# generate.py -h 

USAGE:
        generate.py [opts]

  Options:
        -h, --help:     show this help
        -f:             force creation of all symlinks without asking
        -n:             force creation of new symlinks without asking

If you call generate.py without arguments, you will have to answers to a question
for every symlink. 
        
Restart munin-node and enjoy.

Known Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 - Keep attection if you use SELinux or other kind of Security access framework,
because you have to configure all rights correctly. Usually, my choice is to
put down, because the call of monit get error about access denied.
