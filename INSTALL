These two plugins are made for Apache, so do not use that if you haven't.
Apache needs to be installed and configured before you setup. In this situation,
you can run generate.py script. Usually you need to put nothing but script name, but
you can specify some details too. Here the full call:

# generate.py [<munin plugins conf file> <path plugins> <path_sites_apache>]

Where default is:
<munin plugins conf file> ::= /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node
<path plugins> ::= /etc/munin/plugins
<path_sites_apache> ::= /etc/apache2/sites-enabled

Restart munin-node and enjoy.

Known Problems

1 - Keep attection if you use SELinux or other kind of Security access framework,
because you have to configure all rights correctly. To know which values are
necessary, take a look at /usr/share/munin/plugins folder using ls -alZ.
